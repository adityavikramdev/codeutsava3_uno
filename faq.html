                  Himalaya Capital Exchange is a 2 sided platform to start with, and then will evolve into a

              <br><br>The 2 sides to the platform in the beginning are :<br><br>
              <strong>Issuers:</strong> Entrepreneurs and companies, SMEs around the world wanting to raise capital
              (shares, bonds, syndicated loans) through public markets.<br><br>
              <strong>Investors:</strong> Retail and Institutional investors <br><br>
              Issuers can also include governments , non-profit institutions, associations, trusts etc raising
              capital.
              Eventually, we could also have third party developers, ancillary service providers to capital
              markets in an Amazon kind of market place.

                  The platform will charge user access fees by way of HCX tokens.
          These are the same utility
tokens that are distributed to subscribers during our ICO.<br><br>
The fees will be nominal and similar to “ether” that are staked when you want to create a
smart contract on Ethereum platform. Both issuers and investors have to pay this access fees,
by way of HCX tokens. Eventually, when third party developers come to the platform to
propose their apps, they will also have to stake some tokens in order to propose to publish
their apps to the platform.<br><br>
However, these fees will not be the equivalent of percentage fees that capital markets
intermediaries currently charge (such as 5% that some other ICOs currently charge and
7-10% that investment banks charge, as a percentage of capital raised on the platform). So,
apart from the token access fees that are determined for access to each module depending on
the complexity and criticality of modules, there is no percentage fees. So, in cost terms this is
similar to bitcoin transactions where you can send $100 million or $100 for the same
transaction fees on the bitcoin network.<br><br>
So, as the demand for our platform grows, and there are more issuers and investors thronging
to use our platform, the token price for HCX is expected to appreciate. The company and the
trust dedicated to R&D and upkeep and maintenance of the Himalaya Capital Exchange
platform will also have some tokens issued and earmarked to them. These HCX tokens will
appreciate in value and constitute the reserves that the company has at its disposal. Similarly,
the ICO team and future employees will also be awarded HCX tokens besides any cash
compensation, which will serve as incentives.

                  No. HCX token is a pure <strong>utility token </strong>that is only used to raise money during ICO - for the
funding of the project - that is building Himalaya Capital Exchange, and its business
development.<br><br>
The token that the investors would use to invest in security tokens later, will be the internal
currency within our Himalaya Capital Exchange, (CCX) which will be our native digital
token that is pegged to USD.<br><br>
When companies (or issuers of securities) receive funds in the form of this native currency
called CCX, they can exchange CCX for fiat money at our in-house crypto to fiat exchanges
as and when they like. So the capital raised on our platform is completely fungible, and is
guarded from the volatility typical of the crypto asset class - as it will be pegged to a popular
currency like USD. This anchoring can be flexible in future. For example, if our token
economy decides that a basket of currencies is better than a single currency of USD, then our
peg might change to a basket of currencies.<br><br>
So, the investors buying securities (Security Tokens) on our platform have exactly the same
factors driving their investment decisions as the factors the drive the traditional investors of
shares and bonds on Wall Street or any traditional Stock Exchange - namely fundamentals of
he company, price appreciation potential, attractiveness of the industry, risks and risk
mitigation strategies in place, competitive position, barriers to entry etc.<br><br>
CCX is a security token that can be exchanged for security tokens of each issuer that uses
our platform to create their Security Tokens.<br><br>
So each issuers’s <strong>Initial Security Token Offering (ISTO) </strong>or Initial Scrip Offering will be
denominated in X number of CCX.<br><br>
CCX is easily transferable into fiat, or the real securities of real companies that use our
platform to issue their security tokens.

                  Yes, in the beginning we are going to tie up partnerships with exchanges that can handle
  security tokens. We have identified such exchanges which have applied for securities licenses
  or licenses appropriate for Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). Lykke AG, Switzerland is one
  such exchange which will be securities complaint, and they have already agreed to partner
  with us. We are in discussions with several such exchanges across multiple jurisdictions which
  will allow trading of our security tokens on their platforms and list the security tokens on their
  platforms. We will endeavour to tie up with as many such secondary trading platforms in
  multiple legal jurisdictions as possible.<br><br>
  In the second phase of our roll out, we will also intend to build out a decentralised exchange
  under the Himalaya Capital Exchange banner , to allow the trading of security tokens.

                  Because HCX is one global, borderless, frictionless exchange.
Tokenised shares will be by far more convenient , more liquid and a more easy to trade form
of securities, than paper shares.<br><br>
Removing physical and human barriers and making it a truly online exchange, will improve
capital efficiency and make the landscape more competitive - as per OECD.<br><br>
It is the first democratic solution to the worldwide problem of channelling capital to the most
productive global enterprises.<br><br>
Everyone around the world can use it, with minimum barriers to entry - save for quality.
Issuers are in full control of their capital raise, amount, listing price, allocation, managing the
dynamic process of allocation to different shareholder profiles, investor relations, and investor
communications.<br><br>
Dividend and interets can be distributed automatically through star contracts to accounts of
owners.
Online voting of shareholders is possible.<br><br>
In future, we would make use of AI to create superior intelligent matching algorithms.

                  No, we are the first entity in the world to try and automate the processes in an investment
              bank. We will replicate the order book-building process of investment banks through
              algorithms so the users can calculate the guidance issue price themselves, and can set their
              own Initial Listing Price. <br><br>
              In this information age, we believe there is no need for self-aware and enlightened corporates,
              who are better informed than the intermediaries who evaluate them - to depend on the third
              parties to set share prices for them. <br><br>
              Yes, there are perverse incentives for corporates to inflate prices, but market will not accept
              prices which are not fair. So market discipline is more reliable than discipline imposed by
              centralised third party institutions such as the investment banks - as has been proven by
              vibrant and well-functioning market of sellers and buyers on Amazon, eBay etc.<br><br>
              So, investment banks will no longer be a necessary part of the equation. However, interested
              issuers can still engage investment banks to provide due diligence reports, audit reports etc
              (which are non-essential parts of the IPO). So investment banks will be reduced from their
              current integrated and essential role in IPOs with mandatory high fees of 7-10%. Several
              investment banks, as other freelancers or individuals can bid in our market place to provide
              the due diligence and other services. Market forces will bring down the costs to equilibrium
              fair prices and exert pressure on intermediaries to truly add value to survive, rather than rely
              on their decades-long track record to continue to charge 10% of global capital raising fees -
              which makes capital costly and puts a burden on productivity of enterprises - as per OECD.

                <div class="panel-body">
                  Yes, information asymmetry was a problem in the earlier less evolved technological era. There
            are still perverse incentives for lemons to pass off as quality assets in the absence of merchant
            banks or investment banks putting their stamp on the issue or issuer. But, the platform users
            will perform the role of curation here.<br><br>
            Also, as the quantum of funds raised increases, the market will naturally make the conditions
            more stringent for fundraising. For example, the investors of early stage firms are aware that
            their risk to return ratios are very different from those of established and more mature
            companies. Also, to be able to raise much higher capital, companies would have to show
            multiple thresholds of metrics, parameters of success, trustworthiness or quality, as opposed to
            seed stage or early stage firms which may have little to show and therefore can aspire to
            raising only smaller capital. In any case, since all issuers are raising capital through legitimate
            securities, they are accountable for fair and full disclosures as to risk factors. <br><br>
            Additionally, the curation exercise in our market design where token holders stake their tokens
            to choose and rank issuers will act as a market disciplining incentive for a fair evaluation of
            quality, rather than some third parties who are susceptible to moral hazard. Moral Hazard
            and Agency Costs will always tempt investment banks (as has been proven in many instances)
            in trying to safeguard interests of their well paying clients (hedge funds etc) at the expense of
            other small retail investors. So our system will bring fairer market practices and will curb the
            caramelisation and monopolistic behaviour of banks.

                  Algorithms on our platform that will replicate the order book building of investment banks.
The Order Book Building module will build an order book with investors for a limited range
of prices and will generate a chart to tell you how much can you raise at each stock price and
what amount of funding can you raise for what dilution? Based on that there is an optimal
issue price you can choose, without referring to an investment bank. <br><br>
Anyway, this order book is real because it is generated by real investors in a real market place.
So when you launch the issue in real, those investors will then subscribe to your issue by a

                  Firstly, HCX token holders will be the proxy beneficiaries of this platform , because there are
no separate class of tokens or shares issued to founders or management. Everyone has the
same token. So if token price appreciates, all the token holders benefit. So everyone’s interests
are perfectly aligned.<br><br>
Secondly, HCX token holders can help us grow the platform by bringing in companies to list
their security tokens on the platform - working as growth hackers or growth influencers for
the platform, especially in early stages. <br><br>
Thirdly, HCX token holders will have opportunities to participate in the functioning of the
platform as follows:<br><br>
<ol>

<li>By choosing which issuers will get priority in listing (thereby serving the platform curation
function). Binance has introduced this function for their token. However, we will put a
maximum ceiling on the number of tokens for any rank so that there is no chase to the
moon (or for the first rank) by getting into a token staking war, which is not productive
beyond a point.</li>
<li>By voting for some community decisions staking their tokens.</li>
<li>By rating and scoring of issuers and investors (just like seller ratings in amazon) thereby
keeping free loaders away and preserving the quality of the platform - which is essential to
fast growth of positive network effects.</li>

                  Crypto securities (or security tokens) have all the advantages of cryptocurrencies, but backed
by real assets of a company, just like real shares and real bonds are. Security tokens are more
liquid, tradable around the world, more easily transferable, no cost to transfer, easy to exercise
shareholder voting rights on security tokens, and can access investors around the world in
seconds - as opposed to traditional stock exchanges with onerous procedures. Investors can
also access multiple issues from across diverse industries, and around the world, as opposed to
being limited to one geography. <br><br>
Investors can also be assured of money not leaving their wallets or accounts, unless equivalent
security tokens are exchanged for the digital money. So at no point is your capital in someone
else’s custody. This is achieved by smart contracts, which will perform their exchange function
reliably every single time.

                  We believe such a utilitarian platform as HCX needs no marketing. ICOs went viral, as no
one needs to convince companies on a easy fund raising method. Going by the over USD 10
billion already invested by the crypto investors in ICOs, even the investors don’t need any
convincing. However, we still have a customer acquisition strategy. <br><br>
<ol>

<li>Air Drop: We will do a token airdrop around the world, targeting highly populous
countries in Asia, Europe with large concentration of SMEs. This airdrop would not be
targeted at any referrals or marketing, but purely for customer acquisition and incentivisation.
These tokens would be their first access to the crypto world. Ours is the very first token
targeting main stream audiences , industries and investors (who are not yet well versed with
crypto)</li>
<li>Community Leads: The CEO has, over her tour of past 12 months, generated a lot of
enthusiasm in countries around the world and mobilised regional volunteers who are willing
to work on the ground to raise awareness and be regional representatives. We have over a
dozen such representatives spread across Tokyo, Shanghai, Mumbai, Bangalore, Singapore,
HongKOng, Kualalumpur, London, Toronto, Zurich, Geneva, Berlin, Paris, Kiev etc. They will act as initial ambassadors to onboard early companies (issuers) who will list on the
platform.</li>
<li>Beta Sign up : We will have a beta sign up website which will sign up companies around
the world who will wait to go on the platform when it is ready.</li>
<li> HCX Community : HCX Token holders will generate word of mouth and be regional
growth hackers in their regions.</li>
<li>ICOs to ISTOs : We will also undertake wide promotional activities to target successfully
concluded ICOs to consider listing their security tokens on our platform, as a natural
progression of their crypto journeys.</li>

ISTO is a new and easier way to do an IPO. So, ISTO is closer to an IPO than an ICO.<br><br>
ISTO opens up the gateways to capital raising for entrepreneurs across multiple industries as
opposed to ICOs where only crypto and blockchain savvy entrepreneurs are able to raise
money.<br><br>
ISTO has to comply with securities laws across jurisdictions where the issuer and investor
operate.<br><br>
Issuer (or the company issuing securities) has to define what their security stands for, has to
provide a prospectus and sign off on terms and clauses in an undertaking that they are
responsible for providing fair and full disclosure of risks etc.

Sharding on Ethereum etc.. Execution expected in 2019. However, for the initial security
token offering, speed is immaterial. Investors do not care if they get their security token in 1
second or 1 hour or 1 day, because the process has been simplified for them dramatically and
costs have been eliminated, and friction of participation has been eliminated. However, speed
and performance become critical in secondary trading - which will be solved by the next
phase, by which time many decentralised protocols would have matured and made available
in the market.

                  No. Smart contracts are code. Once we have coded an exchange method, it will not change.<br>
We may introduce newer and better types of smart contracts, with more sophisticated
features. But, if smart contracts have already been agreed to, and in force, they will not be
changed - as changing them will be akin to changing the terms of the contract.<br><br><br><br><br>
Initially we envisage the most basic smart contract - which exchanges digital money for digital
security in a wallet. If there is not enough money in the wallet or not enough digital security ,
then the exchange wont take place. Neither the funds nor the digital security can leak via the
smart contract.

                  We are talking about a better way of doing free trade amongst willing participants where the
participants make the market rules and eject those that don’t play properly.<br><br>
Bad behaviour will be penalised by market participants by rankings, scores etc. Token holders
will rank which issuer will be listed first etc.. However, there can be instances when
communities collectively can make bad judgements and may end up supporting a seamster’s
issue. In such instances, the investors will have to take full responsibility for their investments.
The issuers are not free from civil law, prospectus law (which requires them to make fair and
reasonable disclosures before seeking investments), and criminal law. However, as we know,
law enforcement is reactive than proactive, and we hope the market enforced discipline is
reliable to ensure quality participation even before law enforcement can extend its hands to
criminals.<br><br>
Securities regulation is not there to save investors from their bad judgment, but to make sure
the issuers provide reasonable information that can be relied upon in good faith.
